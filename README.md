# So! You've stumbled upon my GitHub profile somehow! 👀

I dont know if you're here from my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejjusbhat), my [website](https://www.tejjusbhat.com), my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFPUKQqGeqHnNjqmmhZu1CcPKUAkYIem/view), or you searched my name on GitHub (it's not creepy, I've done it too 😅). No matter how you found me—you're welcome! 🎉

## The biggest question! What do I do? 🤔

I’m a software developer who was bitten by a radioactive tensor 🧬 and got a knack for AI 🤖. Now I make AI-powered software and try to deploy it on the cloud ☁️ in hopes of learning something new or making a quick buck 💸.

Currently, I am in my final year of college 🎓, pursuing a B.Tech in CSE (Data Science) at ABES Engineering College, and looking for a place where I can contribute my skills (and make a living, of course 💼). If you're looking to hire me—don't think twice! DO IT! (Kidding... or am I? 🤭)

### What have I learnt so far? 💻

- **Frameworks & Libraries:** FastAPI 🚀, Flask 🧪, TensorFlow 🔢, Pytorch 🔥, OpenCV 👁️, React.js ⚛️, Next.js 🌐, GCP ☁️, Docker 🐳  
- **Databases:** MySQL 🗄️, MongoDB 🍃  
- **Concepts:** OOP 💡, RESTful APIs 🌐, Data Science 📊, AI/ML 🤖, Generative AI ✍️, Linux 🐧, Git 🧑‍💻  

I mainly code backend in Python (Flask or FastAPI) 🛠️, sometimes Node.js 🌿, and frontend in Next.js 🌐. You can check out my full resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFPUKQqGeqHnNjqmmhZu1CcPKUAkYIem/view).
